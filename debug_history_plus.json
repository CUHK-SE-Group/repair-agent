According to the comments of the failed JUnit tests, the exceptions are raised in cases where the `PeriodType` specified is `PeriodType.months()`, which consists of only months and no years. Thus, if there are any years involved in the period, the `UnsupportedOperationException` will be raised as `PeriodType.months()` doesn't support year field.\n\nLooking at the buggy code, even though the months accumulated over the years are normalized, the code does not implement a check to determine whether the `PeriodType` supports years or months before setting these normalized values, resulting in an `UnsupportedOperationException`.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nCompute the total number of months from years and months values. Before setting the values, check if the PeriodType supports year and month fields using the isSupported method.

For a character c without an entity name, if it's an ASCII character, it is written directly and if it's a non-ASCII character, its numeric character reference is written.\n\nThe bug is due to the fact that in the else condition, the character c is directly converted to an integer to prepare the numeric character reference. However, for characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) range (characters with code points > U+FFFF), they are treated as two separate surrogate pairs, which results in two separate numeric character references instead of one.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe solution is that the surrogate pairs should be combined into one value before creating the numeric character reference. This can be achieved by checking if a character is a high surrogate (D800 to DBFF) and if true, convert it and the next char, which is a low surrogate (DC00 to DFFF), to a supplementary character.\n\n**Patch**:\n\n```diff\n<line3> for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n<line4>     char c = str.charAt(i);\n+    if (Character.isHighSurrogate(c)) {\n+        int codePoint = str.codePointAt(i);\n+        writer.write(\"&#\");\n+        writer.write(Integer.toString(codePoint, 10));\n+        writer.write(';');\n+        i++; // skip the low surrogate\n+        continue;\n+    }\n<line5> String entityName = this.entityName(c);\n```\n\nWith these changes integrated, we can correctly escape higher Unicode characters that are represented as surrogate pairs in Java."
